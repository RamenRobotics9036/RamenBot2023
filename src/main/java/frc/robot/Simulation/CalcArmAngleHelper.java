 * The CalcArmAngleHelper class is responsible for calculating the signed degrees

 * 
 * <p>
 * Parts of the robot:
 * Winch - The winch is the motor that pulls the string
 * Arm - Robot arm, which rotates around the pivot point
 * Pivot Point - The pivot point is the point where the arm rotates around
 * Arm Back End - The back end of the arm, which is the end that is furthest away from the grabber
 * Arm Angle - The angle of the arm, relative to the ground
 * String - Connects winch to arm back end
